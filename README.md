# MinecraftVTC
MinecraftVTC (MVTC) Stands for Minecraft Voice To Chat and allows you to speak simple voice commands to send chat messages.

IMPORTANT:
Make sure to speak clearly and (kinda) slowly for the best results as it does not confirm messages before sending them.
<br>
The program needs to run in administrator mode to enable the blocking of your keyboard while it types your message.


Instructions for use:
<br>
Once you run the program wait until the model loads, this is represented by "-> Start <-" being printed in the console.
* To activate you speak into your microphone one of the following commands (similar to Alexa).
* "say" <message>   This will open Minecraft chat (with "t") paste in whatever message you said and then press enter.
* "shout" <message> This will do similar, except it will put /shout before the message, useful for Hypixel (this is less consistent than the other commands).
* "party" <message> This will do the same as above except with /pc.
* "chat" <message> This will do /ac.
* "cancel" This isn't a command, rather if it is included in any command (in any position in the sentence) it won't send the chat, this is to prevent accidental messages

You can also open up your Minecraft inventory to prevent a message form being sent, this is because "t" to open up chat won't work when that screen is open.

Note: 
The whole process takes about 3 seconds in total after you finish talking.
It will block your keyboard (since random keys can mess up the message) this is for about 0.4 seconds.
