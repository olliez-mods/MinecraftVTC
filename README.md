# MinecraftVTC
MinecraftVTC (MVTC) Stands for Minecraft Voice To Chat and allows you to speak simple voice commands to send chat messages.

Instructions for use:

Once you run the program wait until the model loads, this is represented by "-> Start <-" being printed in the console.

To activate you speak into your microphone one of the following commands (similar to Alexa).

"say" <message>   This will open Minecraft chat (with "t") paste in whatever message you said and then press enter.

"shout" <message> This will do similar, except it will put /shout before the message, useful for Hypixel (this is less consistent than the other commands).

"party" <message> This will do the same as above except with /pc.

"chat" <message> This will do /ac.


Note: 
The whole process takes about 3 seconds in total after you finish talking.
It will block arrow keys and WASD while pasting into the chat box (since these can mess up the message) this is for about 0.4 seconds. This means that you can send messages while running around etc.
